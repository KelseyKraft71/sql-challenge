# SQL Challenge UTA Data Analysis

In this challenge, we were tasked with creating a new SQL database and analysing the contents of six CSV files the company has for those the company employed in the 1980's and 1990's.

In this repo, you will find .sql files for table schemata, the queries themselves, and an image file of the QuickDBD diagram created before actually creating the DB.

Once the QuickDBD relationship diagram was completed, I exported the base code to Visual Studio Code and then doctored the contents to fit my specific needs/preference. Other than that, I did not need resources outside of class materials to complete this assignment.

Database creation and querying was completed in PostgreSQL via pgAdmin.
